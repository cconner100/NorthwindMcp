# Copy environment template and customize if needed
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start the Northwind database
make up
```


You can verify Database Connection by using the following command:

```bash
# Test database connectivity
make test

# Or open an interactive SQL shell
make query
```

## Set up Configuration
### Set up OpenAI API key
If you do not want to use the AI features, you can skip this step. If you want to use the AI features, you must set your OpenAI API key. 
To set your OpenAI API key, edit the OpenAI configuration properties in the *appsettings.json* file in the *Client** project:

 ```json
 "OpenAI": {
    "Endpoint": "your-azure-openai-endpoint",
    "Key": "your-azure-openai-key",
    "DeploymentName": "your-deployment-name"
  },
 ```
### Set up MCP Server Configuration
Change Arguments in the *appsettings.json* file in the *Client* project to point to the NorthwindMcpServer.csproj file. This is required for the AI features to work properly.
```json
    "ZiiDMSNextGen": {
      "Arguments": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "{YOUR-FULL-PATH}\\NorthwindMcpServer.csproj"
      ],
 ```

### Set up for debugging purposes
You need to add more arguments to the *appsettings.json* file in the *Client* project to enable debugging. This is useful if you want to debug the MCP server while running it from the client.
```json
    "ZiiDMSNextGen": {
      "Arguments": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "{YOUR-FULL-PATH}\\NorthwindMcpServer.csproj"
        "--",
        "--attach-debugger"
      ],
 ```

## Let's run the MCP Server
### Build the project
```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run the project
The client will automatically start the server as a subprocess:
After running the command, you can attache the debugger to the server process if you have set up the debugging arguments in the *appsettings.json* file.

```bash
cd Client
dotnet run
```

*Happy querying with MCP! ðŸŽ¯*


## ðŸ“‡ Appendix:

### Docker Environment

- **SQL Server 2022** running the Northwind database
- **Persistent storage** with Docker volumes
- **Health checks** for reliable startup
- **Environment-based configuration**
- **Easy deployment** with Docker Compose and Makefile

### MCP Implementation
- **Server**: Console application that connects to Northwind database and provides customer query functionality
- **Client**: Test client with AI integration (Anthropic Claude) for natural language queries
- **Database**: SQL Server 2022 running in Docker with fully populated Northwind sample database

### With AI (if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is configured):
```
> Show me all customers
> Find customers with 'Alfreds' in their name
> How many customers are in Germany?
> List customers from London
```

### Direct Tool Mode (no API key):
```
> all                    # Get all customers
> search Alfreds         # Search for customers containing "Alfreds"
> exit                   # Exit application
```

### Key Technologies

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: For server-client communication
- **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient**: SQL Server database connectivity
- **Anthropic SDK**: AI integration for natural language processing
- **Microsoft.Extensions.AI**: AI abstraction layer
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting**: Application hosting and dependency injection

## Database Connection

The server connects to SQL Server using:
- **Server**: `localhost,1433`
- **Database**: `Northwind` 
- **Authentication**: SQL Server (`sa` user)
- **Password**: `YourStrong@Passw0rd`
- **Trust Server Certificate**: `true` (for development)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues**: 
   - Ensure the Docker container is running: `docker ps`
   - Test connection: `docker exec northwind-db /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'YourStrong@Passw0rd' -C -Q "SELECT 1"`

2. **MCP Communication Issues**:
   - Check that both client and server are using compatible MCP versions
   - Review console logs for error messages

3. **AI Integration Issues**:
   - Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Check API key permissions and rate limits
